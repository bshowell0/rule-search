                <li><a id="1.A">1.A.</a> Description: Ultimate is a non-contact, self-officiated disc sport played by two teams of seven players. The object of the game is to score goals. A goal is scored when a player catches any legal pass in the end zone that player is attacking. A player may not run while holding the disc. The disc is advanced by passing it to other players. The disc may be passed in any direction. Any time a pass is incomplete, a turnover occurs, resulting in an immediate change of the team in possession of the disc. Players are empowered to self-officiate using a framework governed by the principles of Spirit of the Game.</li>

An intentional infraction is cheating and considered a gross offense against the Spirit of the Game. Players are morally bound to abide by the rules and not gain advantage by knowingly committing an infraction, or calling one where none exists.

Generally speaking, due to <a href="https://usaultimate.org/rules/#17.L">17.L</a>, calls made by another player cannot be said to affect play. However, in limited situations for contested marking violation calls, when the marker diverts their attention away from marking while reasonably and quickly assessing the conditions to the thrower’s marking violation call, the marker could determine that play was affected. For example, the thrower calls straddle, and while the marker is looking at their feet to assess their marking position, the thrower completes a throw around the marker. If the marker subsequently contests the straddle because they assessed that they weren’t committing a marking violation, they could claim that play was affected and the disc should be returned to the thrower.
