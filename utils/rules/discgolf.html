  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>The
 object of the game of disc golf is to complete a course in the fewest 
throws of the disc. A course typically consists of nine or eighteen <dfn>holes</dfn>, each of which is a separate unit for scoring.</p>
<p>Play on each hole begins at the tee and ends at the target. After the
 player has thrown from the tee, each successive throw is made from 
where the previous throw came to rest. On completing a hole, the player 
proceeds to the teeing area of the next hole, until all holes have been 
played.</p>
<p>Disc golf courses are normally laid out in and around wooded areas 
with diverse terrain to provide natural obstacles to the flight of the 
disc. The course must not be altered by the player in any way to 
decrease the difficulty of a hole. Players must play the course as they 
find it and play the disc where it lies unless otherwise allowed by 
these rules.</p>

  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><ol type="A">
<li>These rules have been designed to promote fair play for all disc 
golfers. In using these rules, the player should apply the rule that 
most directly addresses the situation at hand. If any point in dispute 
is not covered by the rules, the decision is made in accordance with 
fairness. Often a logical extension of the closest existing rule or the 
principles embodied in these rules will provide guidance for determining
 fairness.</li>
</ol>

<div id="node-236686" class="section-4">
  <h1 class="book-heading">801.02 Enforcement</h1>
  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><ol type="A">
<li>Players are assigned to play holes together in a <dfn>group</dfn> for the purpose of verifying scores and ensuring play in accordance with the rules.</li>
<li>Players are expected to call a violation when one has clearly 
occurred. A call must be made promptly to be enforceable (except for 
misplays).</li>
<li>A player in the group may call or confirm a rules violation on any player in the group by notifying all players in the group.</li>
<li>A <dfn>warning</dfn> is the initial advisement a player is given for
 violating certain rules; subsequent violations of the rule incur 
penalty throws. A call for a rules violation that results in a warning 
does not need to be confirmed to be enforced. Warnings do not carry over
 from one round to the next, nor to a playoff.</li>
<li>A <dfn>penalty throw</dfn> is a throw added to a player's score for 
violating a rule, or for relocation of the lie as called for by a rule. A
 call made by a player for a rules violation that results in one or more
 penalty throws can only be enforced if the call is confirmed by another
 player in the group or by a Tournament Official. A rules violation call
 made by a player on themself does not need to be confirmed in order to 
be enforced unless objected to by a player in the group or by a 
Tournament Official.</li>
<li>The <dfn>Director</dfn> is the person in charge of the tournament or
 event. The Director may be a Tournament Director (TD), a Course 
Director, or a League Director. Only the Director may disqualify a 
player. Decisions made by the Director are final.</li>
<li>A <dfn>Tournament Official</dfn>, or <dfn>Official</dfn>, is a 
person who is authorized by the Director to make judgments regarding the
 proper application of the rules during play. An Official may call or 
confirm a rule violation by any player. An Official's call does not need
 to be confirmed to be enforced. An Official who is playing may not act 
as an Official for players who are in their division.</li>
<li>A <dfn>Tournament Spotter</dfn> is an individual empowered by the 
Director for a specific spotting purpose without authorizing them to act
 as a Tournament Official.</li>
<li>A throw or an action that is subject to penalty under more than one 
rule is played under the rule that results in the most penalty throws; 
or, among rules that call for an equal number of penalty throws, the 
rule that was first violated.</li>
<li>When the flight, position, or status of a disc is questionable, the 
determination is made by the group. When a group cannot reach a majority
 decision, the ruling is based on the interpretation that is most 
beneficial to the thrower.</li>
</ol>

<div id="node-236691" class="section-4">
  <h1 class="book-heading">801.03 Appeals</h1>
  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><ol type="A">
<li>A player may appeal warnings, penalties, or group decisions to an 
Official, or an Official's decision to the Director, by clearly and 
promptly stating that desire to the group. If an Official or the 
Director is readily available, the group may stand aside and allow other
 groups to play through while the appeal is being heard.</li>
<li>If an Official or Director is not readily available to consider an 
appeal, the thrower may make a set of provisional throws (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/80902">809.02</a>)
 and later appeal the ruling to an Official or to the Director when 
practical. If the lies are the same, no additional set of throws is 
made.</li>
<li>If a ruling is overturned, an Official or the Director may adjust 
the player's score to reflect the correct interpretation of the rules. 
Alternatively, the Director may have the player replay one or more 
holes. Rulings by the Director are final.</li>
<li>If, upon arriving at the thrown disc, the group determines a 
Tournament Spotter's ruling is incorrect, the player continues play from
 a lie based on the ruling of the group. The sequence of throws based on
 the spotter's incorrect signal is disregarded. A player may appeal the 
group's ruling and continue the original sequence with a provisional 
sequence of throws.</li>

<li>A <dfn>throw</dfn> is the propulsion and release of a disc in order to change its position. </li>
<li>Each throw that is made as a competitive attempt to change the lie is counted, unless by rule it is disregarded.</li>
<li>For a throw that is disregarded, any penalty throws associated with 
making that throw are also disregarded. Penalties that are associated 
with making a throw are those for: out-of-bounds, hazard, missed 
mandatory, above two meters, stance, marking, taking improper relief,

<li>Throwing order on the tee of the first hole is the order in which the players are listed on the scorecard(s).</li>
<li>Throwing order on all subsequent tees is determined by the scores on
 the previous hole, so that the player with the lowest score throws 
first, and so on. Ties do not change the throwing order.</li>
<li>After all players have a lie other than the teeing area, the player whose lie is farthest from the target (the <dfn>away player</dfn>)
 is next in the throwing order. If two or more players have lies that 
are the same distance from the target, the playing order is the order in
 which those lies were established.</li>
<li>If a player is making another throw from the same lie, or a re-throw, that player remains next in the throwing order. A <dfn>re-throw</dfn> is an additional throw from the same lie which is played instead of the original throw.</li>
<li>To facilitate flow of play, a player who is not next may throw if 
the player who is next consents, or if throwing will not impact the 
player who is next.</li>
<li>Throwing out of order is a courtesy violation.</li>
<li>During tournament play, no group may play through the group ahead 
unless directed by an Official, or if the group ahead is standing aside

  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><ol type="A">
<li>A player has taken excessive time if they are present and have not thrown within 30 seconds:

<li>After they have had a reasonable amount of time to arrive at and determine the lie; and,</li>
<li>After they are next in the throwing order; and,</li>
<li>During which the playing area remains clear.</li>

<li>A player who takes excessive time receives a warning for the first 
violation. A player who takes excessive time after having been warned 
for it during the round receives one penalty throw. See <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/811">811.F.5</a> for a player who is absent when it is their turn to throw.</li>
<li>A player may request extra time from the group to take a bathroom 
break. If the player does not return in a reasonable time, the player is
 considered missing for the hole and receives a score of par plus four

  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><ol type="A">
<li>Play begins on each hole with the player throwing from within the hole's teeing area. A <dfn>teeing area</dfn>, or <dfn>tee</dfn>,
 is the area bounded by the edges of a tee pad, if provided. Otherwise, 
it is the area extending three meters perpendicularly behind the 
designated tee line. The <dfn>tee line</dfn> is the line at the front of the teeing area, or the line between the outside edges of two tee markers.</li>
<li>When the disc is released, the player must have at least one 
supporting point within the teeing area, and all supporting points must 
be within the teeing area. A <dfn>supporting point</dfn> is any part of 
the player's body that is, at the time of release, in contact with the 
playing surface or any other object that provides support. The player is
 allowed to have a supporting point outside the teeing area before or 
after, but not at, the moment the disc is released.</li>

  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><ol type="A">
<li>The <dfn>lie</dfn> is the place on the playing surface upon which the player takes a stance in order to throw. The <dfn>playing surface</dfn>
 is a surface, generally the ground, which is capable of supporting the 
player and from which a stance can reasonably be taken. A playing 
surface may exist above or below another playing surface. If it is 
unclear whether a surface is a playing surface, the decision is made by 
the Director or by an Official.</li>
<li>The lie for the first throw on a hole is the teeing area.</li>
<li>A drop zone is a lie. A <dfn>drop zone</dfn> is an area on the 
course, as designated by the Director, from which a throw is made under 
certain conditions. A drop zone may either be marked and played in the 
same manner as a teeing area, or in the same manner as a marked lie. A 
teeing area may be used as a drop zone.</li>
<li>In all other cases, the lie is a rectangle that is 20cm wide and 
30cm deep, centered on the line of play behind the rear edge of the 
marker disc. The <dfn>marker disc</dfn>, or <dfn>marker</dfn>, is the disc used to mark the lie according to <a href="#80206">802.06</a>.</li>
<li>The <dfn>line of play</dfn> is the imaginary line on the playing 
surface extending from the center of the target through and beyond the 
center of the marker disc.  If that playing surface ends, the line of 
play continues on the nearest playing surface following that line. If 
the lie is a teeing area, the point on the teeing area closest to the 
target is used instead of the marker disc to establish the line of play.</li>

  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><ol type="A">
<li>The position of a thrown disc on the in-bounds playing surface marks the lie.</li>
<li>Alternatively, the player may mark the lie by placing a mini marker 
disc on the playing surface, touching the front of the thrown disc on 
the line of play. A <dfn>mini marker disc</dfn> is a small disc, not used in play, that complies with <a href="https://www.pdga.com/technical-standards">PDGA Technical Standards</a> for mini marker discs.</li>
<li>When the thrown disc is not on the in-bounds playing surface, or 
when the lie is to be moved by rule, the player marks the lie by placing
 a mini marker disc in accordance with the applicable rule.</li>
<li>Throwing from a lie marked in a manner other than described above is
 a marking violation. A player receives a warning for the first marking 
violation. A player receives one penalty throw for each subsequent 
violation of any marking rule during the round.</li>

<li>Have no supporting point closer to the target than the rear edge of the marker disc; and,</li>
<li>Have all supporting points in-bounds.</li>

 a stance has been taken, the player may not move an obstacle in order 
to make room for a throwing motion. It is legal for a player's throwing 
motion to cause incidental movement of an obstacle.</li>
<li>A player is not allowed to move any obstacle on the course, with the following exceptions:
<ol>
<li>A player may move casual obstacles that are on the playing surface farther from the target than the front edge of the lie. A <dfn>casual obstacle</dfn>
 is any item or collection of loose debris (such as stones, leaves, 
twigs, or unconnected branches), or any item as designated by the 
Director.&nbsp;Objects intentionally placed as part of the course or 
event are not casual obstacles.</li>
<li>A player may request that other people move themselves or their belongings.</li>
<li>A player may restore course equipment to its proper working order, including the removal of obstacles.</li>

<li>A player may obtain relief from the following obstacles: harmful 
insects or animals, or any item as designated by the Director. To obtain
 relief, the player may mark a new lie that is on the line of play, 
farther from the target, at the nearest point that provides relief 
(unless greater relief is announced by the Director).</li>
<li>If an obstacle physically prevents the player from taking a legal 
stance behind the marker disc, or from marking a lie for a thrown disc 
which is above or below the playing surface, the player may mark a new 
lie on the line of play immediately behind that obstacle.</li>
<li>A player who takes relief other than as allowed by rule has committed a misplay for playing from an incorrect lie, see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/811">811.F.1</a>.</li>
<li>A player may elect at any time to take optional relief by declaring 
their intention to the group. The lie may then be relocated by marking a
 new lie which is farther from the target and is on the line of play. 
One penalty throw is added to the player's score.</li>

 every player in the group. Any warnings or penalty throws are to be 
noted along with the score for the hole.</li>
<li>The score for a player on a hole is the total number of throws,

<li>It is the responsibility of the player to play the course correctly. Before play begins, players are expected to attend the <dfn>players' meeting</dfn>
 in order to learn about any special conditions that may exist on the 
course, including extra holes, alternate teeing areas, alternate hole 
placements, out-of-bounds areas, mandatories, and drop zones.</li>
<li>A <dfn>misplay</dfn> has occurred if the player either has failed to
 complete every hole on the course correctly and in the proper order or 
has played from an incorrect lie for any throw.</li>
<li>If a misplay is discovered after the scorecard has been turned in, 
the player receives the penalty throws applicable to the misplay.</li>
<li>A misplay is not a stance violation, nor is it a practice throw.</li>
<li>A player who deliberately misplays the course to gain competitive advantage may be disqualified in accordance with <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/303">Section 3.03 of the Competition Manual</a>. This includes but is not limited to any deliberate misplays specified in 811.F.</li>
<li>Types of misplay:
<ol>
<li><u>Incorrect Lie</u>. The player has played from a lie that is not the correct lie. For example, the player has:<br>
<ol type="a">
<li>Teed off from a teeing area that is not the correct teeing area for the current hole; or,</li>
<li>Thrown from a lie other than that established by the thrown disc; or,</li>
<li>Played an out-of-bounds disc as if it were in-bounds; or,</li>
<li>Thrown from a lie established by a previous throw which missed a mandatory; or,</li>
<li>Played a disc in a relief area as if it were not in a relief area.</li>
</ol>
<p>		If no subsequent throws have been made after the misplayed throw, 
that throw is disregarded. The player plays from the correct lie and 
receives one penalty throw for the misplay. If an additional throw has 
been made after the misplayed throw, the player continues play from 
their current lie and receives two penalty throws for the misplay. Any 
penalty throws applicable to the throws used are assessed in addition to
 the penalties for the misplay.</p></li>
<li><u>Failure to Complete a Hole</u>. The player has finished the round
 or thrown on a hole without having completed a previous hole. The score
 for the misplayed hole is the number of throws made, plus one for 
completing the hole, plus two penalty throws for the misplay. 
Intentionally failing to complete a hole constitutes withdrawal from 
competition.</li>
<li><u>Non-Sequential Play</u>. The player has completed play on a hole 
in the wrong order. The player continues to play the course in its 
proper order. Regardless of the number of holes played in the wrong 
order during the round, a total of two penalty throws is added to the 
player's total score for the misplay. The score for any completed hole 
stands.</li>
<li><u>Absent</u>. If a player is not present at the start of the round 
for their assigned group, the player is considered absent and does not 
play the hole. A player is also considered absent if the player has not 
played the previous hole and is not present when their group is ready to
 start on a hole. The absent player receives a score of par plus four on
 each hole not played. <em>Par</em> is determined by the Director.</li>
<li><u>Missing</u>. If a player was present with the group and is now 
missing when it is their turn to throw, the player is given 30 seconds 
to rejoin the group. If the player remains missing for that time, then 
the player is considered absent for the hole and receives a score of par
 plus four on the hole. See <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/80203">802.03.C</a> for exception to this rule.</li>
<li><u>Omitted Hole</u>. The round has been completed, and the player 
has neglected to play one or more holes. The player receives a score of 
par plus four on each unplayed hole. Intentionally failing to play a 
hole constitutes withdrawal from competition.</li>
<li><u>Incorrect Hole</u>. The player has completed a hole that is not 
part of the course for that round, in place of a hole that is part of 
the course for the round. Two penalty throws are added to the player's 
score for the hole.</li>
<li><u>Extra Hole</u>. The player has completed a hole that is not part 
of the course for that round. Two penalty throws are added to the 
player's total score. Throws made on the extra hole are not counted.</li>
<li><u>Wrong Starting Group</u>. The player has begun play in a group 
other than the one to which they were assigned. The player must find 
their assigned group to begin play. Any throws made by a player in the 
wrong group are disregarded. The player is subject to penalties for 
being absent from their assigned group.</li>
<li><u>Wrong Starting Hole</u>. The group has begun play on a hole other
 than the one to which they were assigned. If any player in the group 
makes more than one throw on the hole, the entire group has misplayed 
the hole. The group completes the hole, and each player adds two penalty
 throws to their score for the hole. Otherwise, the players who have 
made a single throw each receive one penalty throw and the misplayed 
throw is disregarded. The group then proceeds to the correct hole to 
begin their round.</li>

<li>In <dfn>match play</dfn>, a pair of players competes against each 
other in an effort to win each hole during the round. The player who 
wins more holes wins the match.</li>
<li>The Official Rules of Disc Golf (which describe <dfn>medal play</dfn>) are to be used except where superseded by these rules.</li>
<li>A pair of opponents plays in a group with at least one other pair, or an Official.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="A.02">A.02 Order of Play</h2>
<ol type="A">
<li>The teeing order for pairs of opponents in the same group follows the order on the scorecard.</li>
<li>Within each pair of opponents, the player listed first on the 
scorecard throws first on the first hole. On all subsequent holes, the 
player who won the previous hole throws first. Ties do not change the 
throwing order.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="A.03">A.03 Penalties</h2>
<ol type="A">
<li>Penalties and warnings assessed between holes apply to the next hole.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="A.04">A.04 Scoring</h2>
<ol type="A">
<li>Scoring in match play is recorded in terms of which player has won 
more holes at any given point. The match starts with the pair tied, or <dfn>all square</dfn>. As the match progresses, the player who has won more holes is <dfn>up</dfn> that many holes; their opponent is <dfn>down</dfn> that many holes.</li>
<li>A player wins a hole by completing the hole in fewer throws than 
their opponent. The player who won the hole receives a score of 1. The 
other player receives no score, which can be indicated by a dash. If the
 two players complete the hole with the same number of throws, the hole 
is <dfn>halved</dfn>, and neither player receives a score.</li>
<li>A player may ask their opponent how many throws they have made on 
the current hole. A player who falsely reports that number loses the 
hole.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="A.05">A.05 Conceding</h2>
<ol type="A">
<li>A player may concede a match at any time before the conclusion of the match. The opponent wins the match.</li>
<li>A player may concede a hole at any time before both players have completed the hole. The opponent wins the hole.</li>
<li>A player may concede their opponent's next throw. The throw is considered to have completed the hole.</li>
<li>A pair of players may agree to halve the hole being played.</li>
<li>A concession may not be declined or withdrawn.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="A.06">A.06 Winning the Match</h2>
<ol type="A">
<li>When a player is up more holes than there are holes remaining to be played, that player has won the match.</li>
<li>If a pair of players is all square at the end of the round, the 
match is tied. The Director decides if and how ties are to be broken.</li>

  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><h2 id="B.01">B.01 General</h2>
<ol type="A">
<li>A doubles team consists of two players. Alternative formats with 
different team sizes are possible and can be extrapolated from these 
rules.</li>
<li>The Official Rules of Disc Golf are to be used except where superseded by these rules.</li>
<li>For the purposes of team scoring, <i>team</i> shall be substituted for <i>player</i> in section <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/808">808, Scoring</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="B.02">B.02 Order of Play</h2>
<ol type="A">
<li>The throwing order for the first hole is the order in which the 
teams are listed on the scorecard(s). Throwing order on all subsequent 
tees is determined by the scores on the previous hole, so that the team 
with the lowest score throws first, and so on. Ties do not change the 
throwing order.</li>
<li>After all teams have a lie other than the teeing area, the team 
whose lie is farthest from the target is next in the throwing order.</li>
<li>Members of a team who are throwing from the same lie may throw in either order.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="B.03">B.03 Penalties</h2>
<ol type="A">
<li>Penalties incurred by a throw apply only to the team member who made
 the throw. All other warnings and penalties are incurred by the team as
 a whole and are scored against the team regardless of format.</li>
<li>Any throw which cannot possibly improve a team's score is an <dfn>extra throw</dfn>.
 A team whose member has made an extra throw receives a warning for the 
first violation, and a penalty throw for each subsequent violation by 
any member of the team.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="B.04">B.04 Lie</h2>
<ol type="A">
<li>In formats where both team members throw from the same lie, a team 
member who throws from a lie other than the lie played by the first 
member to throw receives one penalty throw for misplay.</li>
<li>A lie being played by both team members must be marked using the same marker disc. Failure to do so is a marking violation.</li>
<li>If a lie being played by both team members is relocated for any reason, both members must play from the relocated lie.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="B.05">B.05 Formats</h2>
<ol type="A">
<li>Best Throw
<ol>
<li>Both team members throw from the teeing area. The team then chooses 
which of the two positions to play from for the next throw. Both team 
members throw from the resulting lie, and the team again chooses which 
of the two positions to play from, and so on.</li>
<li>A team completes a hole when either team member completes the hole.</li>
<li>The score for a team on a hole is the number of throws for the lies that were played, plus any penalty throws.</li>
<li>If a team picks up a thrown disc before a lie has been chosen or 
marked with a marker disc, the team may not choose that throw. If a team
 picks up both thrown discs without a lie having been marked, the second
 disc to have been picked up is replaced to its original position as 
agreed upon by the group, and the team must play from the resulting lie.</li>
<li>If one team member is absent, late, or ceases play, the other team 
member may play, but no throws are made on behalf of the missing team 
member. A late team member may join play only between holes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Modified Best Throw
<ol>
<li>Modified Best Throw is the same as Best Throw, with the following 
variation: The Director may set a limit on when the team may use each 
member's tee throw. The team receives two penalty throws each time that 
limit is exceeded.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Worst Throw
<ol>
<li>Both team members throw from the teeing area. The team's opponents 
then choose which of the two positions the team will play from, with the
 goal of maximizing the team's score on the hole. Both team members 
throw from the resulting lie, and their opponents again choose which of 
the resulting positions the team will play from, and so on.</li>
<li>A team completes a hole when all team members complete the hole from the same lie.</li>
<li>The score for a team on a hole is the number of throws for the lies that were played, plus any penalty throws.</li>
<li>If a team picks up or marks a thrown disc before their opponents 
have chosen a lie, the disc is replaced to its original position as 
agreed upon by the group. The opponents then choose between the 
resulting lie of the moved disc, the lie of the other disc, and the 
previous lie as the lie for the moved disc.</li>
<li>If the opponents choose a clearly favorable lie, they may be disqualified by the Director.</li>
<li>If a team member is absent, late, withdraws, or is disqualified, the team is disqualified.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Tough Throw
<ol>
<li>Tough Throw is the same as Worst Throw, with the following 
variation: A team completes the hole when any team member completes the 
hole.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Alternate Throw
<ol>
<li>The team chooses which member makes the first throw on the first 
hole. They then alternate: each team member throws from the lie 
resulting from the other team member's throw until they complete the 
hole.</li>
<li>A team completes a hole when either team member completes the hole.</li>
<li>The score for a team on a hole is the number of throws by that team, plus any penalty throws.</li>
<li>A throw by the incorrect team member is a misplay and incurs one 
penalty throw. The throw is disregarded, and the correct team member 
throws. If an additional throw has been made after the incorrect team 
member has thrown, the team receives two penalty throws, and play 
continues.</li>
<li>For any re-throw from the same lie, the same player makes the re-throw.</li>
<li>The team receives a score of par plus four on any hole missed by a 
late or absent team member. If either team member withdraws or is 
disqualified, the team is disqualified.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Modified Alternate Throw
<ol>
<li>Modified Alternate Throw is the same as Alternate Throw, with the 
following variation: The Director may designate which team member makes 
the first throw on each hole.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Best Score
<ol>
<li>Each team member plays the hole as an individual player.</li>
<li>A team completes a hole when a team member completes the hole with the lowest potential score for the team.</li>
<li>The score for a team on a hole is the lowest score on the hole by 
either team member, including any penalty throws incurred by that 
player, plus any team penalty throws.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Best Score Alternate Throw
<ol>
<li>Each team member throws from the teeing area, which starts two sequences of Alternate Throw.</li>
<li>A team completes a hole when either sequence of Alternate Throw completes the hole with the lowest potential score for the team.</li>
<li>The score for a team on a hole is the lower of the scores for the 
two Alternate Throw sequences, including any penalty throws incurred 
during that sequence, plus any team penalty throws.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Aggregate Score
<ol>
<li>Each team member plays the hole as an individual player.</li>
<li>The score for a team on a hole is the sum of the scores on the hole 
by all team members including any penalty throws for the individual or 
team.</li>
<li>If any team member withdraws or is disqualified, the team is disqualified.</li>

<ol type="A">
<li>The PDGA is committed to providing an open and inclusive environment
 for all players regardless of disability. To that end, Tournament 
Directors are authorized to hold PDGA-sanctioned events designed for, or
 with components involving, adaptive disc golf, as defined in this 
Appendix F. Nothing in this Appendix F is intended to replace or 
otherwise modify the PDGA policy regarding Reasonable Modification for 
Exemption from PDGA Rules, Regulations, and Procedures for modifications
 not expressly addressed herein. Further, nothing in this Appendix F is 
intended to create, nor shall it be construed to create, any right or 
entitlement for a player in a PDGA-sanctioned event to participate in an
 adaptive disc golf component or to utilize these rules, all of which 
shall be in the sole discretion of the Tournament Director to designate 
an event or component of an event as being an adaptive disc golf event 
or component. Further, except as expressly provided in this Appendix F, 
nothing in this Appendix F is intended to, nor shall it be construed to,
 create additional rights of players or obligations of the PDGA or 
Tournament Directors other than those required by applicable law in that
 jurisdiction.</li>
<li>Where an event offers a component for or is wholly designed for 
adaptive disc golf, the following enhancements to the Official Rules of 
Disc Golf and the <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual">PDGA Competition Manual for Disc Golf Events</a>&nbsp;apply. <dfn>Adaptive disc golf</dfn> means a version of disc golf designed for participants who use a propelled mobility device. A <dfn>propelled mobility device</dfn>
 is a wheelchair or other self- or motor-propelled vehicle. Mobility 
devices which aid in walking but are not propelled by the player or a 
motor, such as a cane or crutches, are not propelled mobility devices.</li>
<li>Where an event uses these enhancements, the Director must be clear 
about the applicability of this Appendix to the event in all 
pre-registration materials.</li>
<li>This Appendix must apply either to specific divisions or to the 
entire event. Events using this Appendix are X-designated events as 
outlined by the <a href="https://www.pdga.com/tour-standards">PDGA Tour Standards</a>
 and would receive or be excluded from ratings in the same manner as 
events of the same type (e.g., singles, team or match play, events 
restricted to PDGA Club or nationality, charitable events) that use the 
standard Official Rules of Disc Golf and <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual">Competition Manual for Disc Golf Events</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="F02">F.02 Divisions and Eligibility</h2>
<ol type="A">
<li>To foster peer-level competition, where events using these 
enhancements are also using a divisional system that classifies athletes
 by impairment, the event must assign each such classification or a 
subset of such classifications to a specific PDGA division or pair of 
PDGA divisions (e.g., a given Paralympic Sport Class or set of Sport 
Classes might be assigned to MA2 and FA2, while another might be 
assigned to FA1 and MA1).</li>
<li>For events using these enhancements, eligibility for a division due 
to classification by impairment under F.02.A, above, supersedes 
ineligibility for that division by rating.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="F03">F.03 Rule Enhancements</h2>
<ol type="A">
<li><a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/80204">802.04 Teeing Off</a>.
 If an adaptive disc golf player uses a propelled mobility device, the 
wheels or other components of that device which rest on the ground to 
provide support, as well as the space between the wheels, are considered
 supporting points for the purposes of this and every other applicable 
rule in the Official Rules of Disc Golf.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/80205">802.05 Lie</a>. When adaptive disc golf players are using a propelled mobility device, the lie will be two meters deep instead of 30cm deep.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/80302">803.02 Relief from Obstacles</a>.
 Conditions such as deep mud, unnavigable terrain, or steep slopes which
 prevent an adaptive disc golf player using a propelled mobility device 
from taking a legal stance behind the marker disc are obstacles as 
described in <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/80302">803.02.B</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/80602">806.02 Out-of-Bounds</a>.
 Adaptive disc golf players using a propelled mobility device obtain 
relief in the same manner as this section details, but those players may
 presume that the Director has authorized them to take up to three 
meters of relief.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/807">807 Completing the Hole</a>.
 At the discretion of the Director, a hoop, no larger than one meter in 
diameter, may be placed on the playing surface and centered on the base 
of the target. The hoop shall be secured to the ground to keep it from 
moving. At the discretion of the Director, adaptive disc golf players 
using a propelled mobility device in specified divisions have also 
completed the hole if their disc comes to rest entirely inside of or 
touching the hoop, with no part of the disc extending outside the hoop.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/81302">813.02 Illegal Device</a>.
 Adaptive disc golf players who are visually impaired may use beepers or
 other sound-emitting devices on discs and targets as a directional aid 
and for easier disc location as if the Director had declared night or 
snow play.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/305">3.05 Carts, Caddies, and Groups</a>. Adaptive disc golf players using a propelled mobility device do not violate the prohibitions of <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/305">3.05.F</a> by using that propelled mobility device.</li>

    <details id="QA-APP-1" open="">
      <summary>
        <h3 class="question">QA-APP-1: Is there a priority order for which violation should count if more than one rule applies?</h3>
      </summary>
      <p class="answer">Yes. The violation with the most severe penalty 
is applied. Ties are broken by what happened first. A single throw 
cannot be penalized for more than one violation.</p>
    </details>
    <details id="QA-APP-2" open="">
      <summary>
        <h3 class="question">QA-APP-2: When multiple violations have 
occurred on a single throw, how do I determine which rule was first 
violated, given that a rule has not been violated until the disc has 
come to rest?</h3>
      </summary>
      <p class="answer">The meaning of “first” in the rule is the common
 understanding of when the disc first enters a state where it is in 
violation of a rule. One common pair of rules that can be violated 
during a single throw are OB and Mandatory.&nbsp;As soon as a disc 
enters the restricted plane it is considered to have missed the 
mandatory, whereas a disc is not considered OB until it comes to rest. 
Therefore, the missed mandatory happened first.</p>

      </summary>
      <p class="answer">If you are playing an event where it is 
announced that PDGA rules apply, then the Official Rules of Disc Golf 
apply, whether the event is sanctioned by the PDGA or not. The 
Competition Manual only applies to PDGA events. If no announcement has 
been made regarding the rules, you can play by whatever rules your group

        <h3 class="question">QA-APP-7: What if there is no Tournament Director?</h3>
      </summary>
      <p class="answer">All PDGA-sanctioned tournaments have a 
Tournament Director. For non-sanctioned events or casual play, if anyone
 has authority over the players, they can take on the responsibilities 
of the Director. If no one wants to be the Director, then you will have 
to play without some of the functions of the Director. For example, 
there may not be any appeals of group rulings. Some Director functions 
may be available in other ways. For example, the course signage should 
tell you in what order to play the holes, where any out-of-bounds is, 
and other things that are normally covered in the players’ meeting or 
caddie book.</p>

        <h3 class="question">QA-APP-8: Everyone in my playing group is a
 certified official. Certain rules require either two players in the 
group or an official to make the call. Can just one of us make these 
calls since we’re all officials?</h3>
      </summary>
      <p class="answer">No. To make calls during tournament play, you 
must have been authorized by the Director as a Tournament Official. 
Passing the test does not make you a Tournament Official (referred to 
throughout the rules as an Official). Additionally, Officials have 
restrictions on making calls depending on whether they are playing or 
not. An Official (including the TD) who is playing cannot act as the 
sole Official for calls that affect players in their division. A 
non-playing Official can be the sole person to make a call where rules 
indicate an Official may make the call. A spotter can make calls (for 
example, regarding the position of a disc that has gone out-of-bounds) 
if they are also an Official. If they are not, their call should be 
considered as input for a group decision.</p>

      </summary>
      <p class="answer">The phrase “benefit of the doubt” is not in the 
rules. Making a ruling based on what benefits the thrower only comes 
into play after the group has made their best effort at determining the 
flight of the disc based on the information they have available. This 
determination should be made without any regard to whether or not the 
decision is beneficial to the thrower. Only if the group cannot come to a
 majority decision on whether or not the disc crossed back in bounds 
should a ruling be based on what is most beneficial to the thrower

        <h3 class="question">QA-TEE-1: How are teeing areas designated?</h3>
      </summary>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Directors may use any of several methods to define the teeing areas and drop zones. A single
          course may use more than one type of tee. When in doubt, ask the Director. Here are some common ways of designating
          teeing areas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If an artificial tee pad is provided and has no markings, the teeing area is the area which contrasts with its
            surroundings in color, material, height, and/or texture.</li>
          <li>Some tee pads are built with a follow-through area in 
front. The follow-through area may be a different color,
            or it may be the part in front of a marked tee line. The 
part of the pad which is behind the follow-through area is the
            teeing area.</li>
          <li>If an outline is marked (whether a complete or partial line, or with four markers), the teeing area is the
            area within the outline. If markers are used, the teeing area is defined by the outside edges of the markers.</li>
          <li>If no artificial tee pad is provided, the teeing area 
extends three meters perpendicularly behind the
            designated tee line. If a line marks the tee line, the 
teeing area includes the marked line. If two tee markers mark the
            tee line, the teeing area extends forward and outward to the
 outer edges of the tee markers.</li>
          <li>If there is only a tee sign, or one tee marker, the tee is to one side of and behind the sign or marker.</li>

concrete tee pad. When I let go, the front of my foot was hanging off 
the front edge of the pad. Was that a stance violation?</h3>
      </summary>
      <p class="answer">No. The rule states that all supporting points 
must be within the teeing area at the time of release. “Supporting 
point” refers to any point on the player that is in contact with the 
playing surface (in this case the tee pad), rather than to a complete 
body part such as a foot. The part of the foot that is hanging off the 
end is not a supporting point because it is not in contact with the 
playing surface, so no violation has occurred.</p>

      </summary>
      <p class="answer">The TD will need to clarify their intentions in 
this situation. If the course rules are unclear, use a provisional. In 
general, if the edges of the water are the OB line, and if the disc is 
completely within that area, regardless of the item it is resting on, 
then the disc is considered OB. The out-of-bounds line extends a 
vertical plane (806.02.F). If any part of your disc is over the in 
bounds shore, then your disc is in bounds.</p>

      </summary>

support is not prohibited by the rules, provided that the object is 
in-bounds. It also must not be moved, since you are required to take the
 stance that results in the least possible movement of obstacles on the

      <p class="answer">Picnic tables, along with any other park or 
course equipment, are obstacles on the course. They are to be treated as
 any other obstacles, for example a bush or a tree. How you play your 
next throw depends on the picnic table. If there is room for you to take
 a stance under it, even by sticking your leg underneath, that’s what 
you do. If your disc is on top of the picnic table and there is room 
underneath, it is a lie above ground, and you mark directly below it and
 play from there. If the disc is on top and there’s no room underneath, 
the table is treated as a solid obstacle, and you mark directly behind 
it on the line of play.</p>

and/or 10cm to the side (half of the lie’s 20cm width), which means that
 your other foot can actually be closer to the target. It just can’t be 
closer than the back of your marker. Also remember that the shape that 
marks the same distance to the target as the back of your marker is a 
circle whose center is the target.</p>

last in-bounds puts me in the middle of the reeds. Can I just go back to
 the tee?</h3>
      </summary>
      <p class="answer">Yes. Going back to the previous lie is one of 
the OB options. Alternatively, you could declare an abandoned throw with
 the same result. You can also take optional relief back along the line 
of play (without it costing you an additional penalty throw) because you
 would be taking optional relief following a penalty for out-of-bounds. 
That is probably your best option.</p>

the OB side. Was the disc briefly over in-bounds when the fence flexed, 
or perhaps by having slightly penetrated a hole in the fence?</h3>
      </summary>
      <p class="answer">No. The fence defines an OB plane which flexes 
as the fence flexes. Unless the disc has penetrated and remained lodged 
within the fence, the fence is considered to be a continuous 
impenetrable surface. Your disc was not in-bounds at any point when it 
struck the fence.</p>

optional relief rule to mark my lie back along the line of play, instead
 of one meter from OB?</h3>
      </summary>
      <p class="answer">Optional relief is available for free (without 
adding a penalty throw) after a throw that results in a penalty throw 
and that requires placement of a lie (such as OB or above two meters). 
First relief is taken as specified in 806.02.D, then optional relief is 
taken straight back on the line of play (803.02.D,E). A player may not 
take one meter of relief from OB after taking optional relief even if 
the relocated lie is near an OB line.</p>

went up to my disc and pushed it down to see if there’s water 
underneath. Is my disc now automatically in-bounds because another 
player touched it?</h3>
      </summary>
      <p class="answer">No. If you move your possibly OB disc, it is 
automatically OB. But there is no corresponding rule that makes it 
automatically in-bounds (nor automatically out-of-bounds) if someone 
else moves it. If that happens, you restore your disc to its approximate

and was called on it (and seconded). Their throw went OB. Do they get a 
warning, a penalty, or two penalties?</h3>
      </summary>
      <p class="answer">A player’s first stance violation results in a 
penalty throw. In this case, there were multiple violations. Normally, 
the first violation to occur is the one that counts. In this case, 
that’s the foot fault (though it doesn’t really matter as it’s one 
penalty throw either way). There’s no re-throw, so the disc is played as
 OB. Since a player cannot receive penalty throws for multiple 
violations on a single throw, there’s just one penalty throw.</p>

Is that point where part of the disc first crossed the line, or when the
 entire disc crossed the line?</h3>
      </summary>
      <p class="answer">It’s when the entire disc crossed the line. To 
be super-technical, since the disc is a circle, there will be a single 
point of last contact with the inner edge of the OB line. That is the 
point you use for marking.</p>

give the benefit of the doubt that it did, right?</h3>
      </summary>
      <p class="answer">The phrase “benefit of the doubt” is not in the 
rules. Making a ruling based on what benefits the thrower only comes 
into play after the group has made their best effort at determining the 
flight of the disc based on the information they have available. This 
determination should be made without any regard to whether or not the 
decision is beneficial to the thrower. Only if the group cannot come to a
 majority decision on whether or not the disc crossed back in bounds 
should a ruling be based on what is most beneficial to the thrower.

      </summary>
      <p class="answer">No. If you choose not to take casual relief back
 along the line of play, then you must take your stance as you would 
anywhere else on the course. The only time you are allowed to move 
obstacles is to move casual obstacles out of your lie. If you do not

      <p class="answer">No. “Casual water” as listed in the rules is 
water as it’s commonly understood, in its liquid form. The rules do not 
grant casual relief from snow, ice, or even steam should you encounter 
it. Note that the Director can announce that ice or snow are casual

      </summary>
      <p class="answer">Unlike OB, a hazard area does not affect where 
one marks their lie, so no relief is granted from a hazard area. A 
player can stand in the hazard area without penalty. The penalty for a 
hazard is based solely on the position of the thrown disc, not on where

      <p class="answer">A penalty for a hazard area only occurs if the 
thrown disc comes to rest completely in the hazard area. You are not 
penalized for the hazard area if you take casual relief for that puddle 
into the hazard area.
      On a related note, if your disc lands in casual water in a hazard

      <p class="answer">You can place it in the tray, but you must

      </summary>
      <p class="answer">It’s hard to say. To demonstrate “full control 
of balance” the player must perform some action that breaks up the flow 
of movement toward the target after release, before proceeding toward 
the target. Some examples of actions that could demonstrate balance 
might be: (1) a clear pause and display of balance, (2) placement of the
 back foot on the ground behind the mark, or (3) retrieval of the marker
 disc. The key to all of those is to show balance and control of your 
body behind the mark before moving forward. The best course of action is
 to leave no room for doubt, which is easy to do if you are indeed in 
control of your body after you’ve released the putt.</p>

ruling until the status of the disc in question can be determined, or an

discs, factory seconds, hot stamp rejects, etc.) of PDGA-approved models
 legal for use in PDGA competitions?</h3>
      </summary>
      <p class="answer">Yes. They are legal for PDGA play as long as 
they also meet the overall restrictions (weight, rim sharpness, 
flexibility, etc.) as outlined by the PDGA Technical Standards document.
 Players always have the right to question the legality of a disc used 
in competition. In such cases the TD will make the final call.</p>

      </summary>
      <p class="answer">Yes. You are allowed to add discs to your bag 
after the round has started. Make sure the errand does not distract 
other players and that you don’t violate the Excessive Time rule. The 
best time to do that is between holes.</p>

      </summary>
      <p class="answer">Yes. You may place a towel or a small pad which 
is less than 1cm thick when compressed on the lie, including within a 
drop zone or teeing area.</p>

      </summary>
      <p class="answer">No, this is a post-production modification which
 alters the original flight characteristics (813.01.C.1). The disc is no
 longer in a round, saucer-like configuration required by the Technical 
Standards. Even though the modification may be temporary, it is illegal 
to throw the disc while in this configuration.</p>

      <p class="answer">No. Once your opponent concedes a throw, you 
have completed the hole. A throw after that is a practice throw. The 
penalty for a practice throw is added to the number of throws it takes 
you to complete the next hole.</p>

 hears the official start signal, they return to the tee and start over.
 None of those throws count as practice throws even if made after the 
two-minute signal. If the group actually started early but never heard 
the official start signal, their scores stand as thrown with no 
penalties.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The PDGA Competition Manual for Disc Golf Events outlines procedures 
and guidelines for PDGA events and is to be used in conjunction with the
 <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf">Official Rules of Disc Golf</a>.
 These procedures, standards, and guidelines are required for all 
PDGA-sanctioned events unless specified otherwise. This includes limited
 exceptions for events in countries outside the United States and 
Canada. All references in the Competition Manual or Tour Standards to a 
"Tournament Director" or "TD" mean the person in charge of the event 
under <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/80102">801.02.G</a>.
 If a Tournament Director finds any provision in any of these documents 
unacceptable, they may request a waiver by contacting the PDGA Director 
of Event Support at <a href="mailto:eventsupport@pdga.com">eventsupport@pdga.com</a>.</p>
<h2>The Spirit of the Game</h2>
<p>Disc golf is typically played without the supervision of a referee or
 umpire. The game relies on the player to show sportsmanship, integrity,
 consideration for other players, and to abide by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf">Official Rules of Disc Golf</a>.
 All players should conduct themselves in a disciplined manner, 
demonstrating courtesy and sportsmanship at all times, irrespective of 
how competitive they may be.</p>
<p><strong><em>Make the call. Accept the call. It’s not personal;&nbsp;it’s the rules. That is the spirit of the game of disc golf.</em></strong></p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">1.01 Player Eligibility</h1>
  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><ol type="A">
<li>All members in good standing of the PDGA are eligible to compete in 
any division for which they qualify based upon class (Professional or 
Amateur), age, gender, and player rating.
<ol>
<li>Exceptions must be approved in advance by the PDGA Director of Event Support.</li>
<li>Please see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/section-2">Section 2: Division Qualifications</a> for more specific information on division eligibility.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Membership Requirements:<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>Current PDGA Membership is required to compete in any Major, Elite Series, A-Tier, or B-Tier event. See <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/603">6.03.A.1</a> for exceptions.</li>
<li>In all other PDGA-sanctioned events, players who are not current 
members may compete by paying a temporary membership fee (not required 
for Leagues, see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/114">1.14.C.1</a>). See <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/603">6.03.A.2</a> for exceptions.</li>
<li>In PDGA-sanctioned events which permit non-members or non-current 
members to compete by paying a temporary membership fee, such a fee will
 not apply to players competing in Junior divisions or where the 
requirement has been waived by the PDGA Director of Event Support (e.g.,
 Women's Global Event or Competition Endowment Program events).</li>

  <h1 class="book-heading">1.02 Tournament Registration</h1>
  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><ol type="A">
<li>Pre-registration is required for A-Tier events, and is recommended 
for all other Tiers. For PDGA Majors and Elite Series events, see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/405">4.05.A</a>.</li>
<li>A player is not officially entered in the event until their entry fee has been received and confirmed by the event.</li>
<li>All openings in the field of play will be filled on a first-come, 
first-served basis unless divisional or Pro/Am class caps have been 
publicized up front with registration, in which case each division or 
class will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis. See exceptions
 to first-come, first-served below.<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>Some exceptions to first-come, first-served are appropriate to reward
 local clubs and volunteers for their grassroots work and service, to 
give the Tournament Director (TD) a useful tool to raise money for a 
tournament that benefits all of the event’s players, and to allow TDs to
 prioritize growing specific demographics of the sport in their area as 
they find appropriate.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>None of these exceptions apply to PDGA Majors or PDGA Elite Series 
events, as those events already have established registration criteria 
through their event agreements with the PDGA. A-Tiers that are held 
concurrently with an Elite Series event may utilize these exceptions.</li>
<li>In all cases, any use of Exceptions must be completely transparent 
and publicly posted at least 48 hours prior to the opening of 
registration in order to provide the opportunity for any player to meet 
the requirements to be included within the specific Exception(s).</li>
<li>The below-listed permitted exceptions (2, 3, &amp; 4) classed as 
Unlimited, Limited, and PDGA Club, are the ONLY exceptions allowed for 
PDGA-sanctioned events beyond a complete 100% first-come, first-served 
registration.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Unlimited Permitted Exceptions</h3>
<p>These Unlimited Permitted Exceptions are not limited by percentage of
 event spots, but the specific early registration tiers for the 
Unlimited Permitted Exception must be first-come, first-served to any 
player who meets the specific requirements of that registration tier. 
TDs may offer tiered registration based on:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>PDGA Player Ratings to give higher-rated players priority (Examples: Elite Series events, USADGC).</li>
<li>qualification through PDGA-sanctioned qualifier events that were 
publicly available to all players. (Example: PDGA Worlds, USDGC, USADGC,
 or a Points Series Finale).</li>
<li>specific divisions that are otherwise underserved. These are limited
 to female-only divisions, junior divisions, or senior (age 50 and 
older) age-based divisions.</li>
<li>current PDGA membership.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Limited Permitted Exceptions</h3>
<h4>Usage Requirements:</h4>
<ol type="a">
<li>TDs may use one or more of the three below-listed Limited Permitted 
Exceptions, but at no time may they allocate more than one-third (33%) 
of an event’s player spots in total to any combination of the Limited 
Permitted Exceptions used. Two-thirds (67%) of the event spots must 
remain for first-come, first-served registrations.</li>
<li>If the event has assigned Pro/Am class caps for registration, no 
more than one-third (33%) of the Pro spots and one-third (33%) of the 
Amateur spots may be allocated in total to any combination of the 
Limited Permitted Exceptions used. Two-thirds (67%) of the event spots 
must remain for first-come, first-served registrations for both Pro and 
Amateur.</li>
<li>If the event has divisional registration caps, no more than one-half
 (50%) of the spots in any division may be allocated to any combination 
of the Limited Permitted Exceptions used. One-half (50%) of the event 
spots must remain for first-come, first-served registrations within any 
offered division.</li>
<li>The Limited Permitted Exceptions are as follows:<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<h5>PDGA Club Membership Exception</h5>
<p>TDs may offer tiered registration to the registered members of local 
disc golf clubs who are hosting, running, or otherwise facilitating the 
event’s success and who are registered as PDGA Clubs. Club membership 
must not be exclusive and must be publicly posted so anyone can meet the
 requirements to be part of the PDGA Club Membership Exception if they 
so choose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Event Sponsorship Exception</h5>
<p>TDs may offer tiered registration to players who agree to sponsor the
 event (or an event sponsor’s designated player) at a level determined 
by the Tournament Director. The sponsorship opportunity must not be 
exclusive and must be publicly posted so anyone can meet the 
requirements to be part of the Event Sponsorship Exception if they so 
choose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Volunteers Exception</h5>
<p>TDs may offer tiered registration to volunteers for their work in 
prepping the course etc., for the event at a level determined by the TD.
 That volunteer opportunity must not be exclusive and must be publicly 
posted so anyone can meet the requirements to be part of the Volunteer 
Exception if they so choose.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h3>PDGA Club Permitted Exception – “Club Members Only” Events</h3>
<ol type="a">
<li>PDGA Clubs with large numbers of members may run a PDGA-sanctioned 
event where registration is open only to the registered members of the 
PDGA Club. See <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/603">6.03.B.1</a> for what constitutes an PDGA Club outside the United States and Canada.</li>
<li>Club membership must not be exclusive and must be publicly posted so
 anyone can meet the requirements to be part of the PDGA Club if they so
 choose.</li>
<li>Registration must be first-come, first-served to all the PDGA Club members.</li>
<li>Since they are not open to the general public, such events will be 
designated as an “X” Tier (XC, XB, XA, etc.), and the event name must 
include the phrase “ – Club Members Only Event” (example: “Shooting the 
Breeze with the Augusta DGC – Club Members Only Event”).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Waitlists will be maintained (overall, by class, or by division) based on the caps that have been publicized in advance.</li>
<li>Entries received via online entry shall be date and time-stamped 
based on the actual time the entry fee was received at the online entry 
point.</li>
<li>In the event that multiple entries are received simultaneously, the player with the lowest PDGA number shall have priority.</li>
<li>Events must post pre-registration lists on the PDGA event results 
page, post waitlists on the official registration page, and update those
 lists at least weekly.</li>
<li>Only paid registrants should be listed on the published tournament list.</li>
</ol>

  <h1 class="book-heading">1.03 Withdrawals and Refunds</h1>
  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><ol type="A">
<li>Players must email or phone their withdrawals to the Tournament 
Director only at the contact information posted for the tournament. 
Discussions with persons other than the Tournament Director, including 
other tournament staff, shall not be considered official.</li>
<li>Players who have paid more than a nominal waitlist fee of $10 to be 
on an event’s waitlist who do not get into the event, or who officially 
request to withdraw from the waitlist prior to the event’s published 
closure of registration and waitlist replacements (within one week is 
recommended), will receive a 100% monetary refund of that waitlist fee 
(minus up to a $10 handling fee). Waitlist players who only paid a 
nominal non-refundable waitlist fee of $10 or less&nbsp;will not receive
 a refund.</li>
<li>Players who officially request to withdraw from an event at least 30
 days before the start of the event will receive a 100% monetary refund 
of their entry fee&nbsp;(minus up to a $10 handling fee).</li>
<li>Players who officially request to withdraw from an event 15 to 29 
days before the start of the event will receive a 100% 
monetary&nbsp;refund of their entry fee&nbsp;minus up to a $10 handling 
fee only if their spot in the tournament is filled&nbsp;by a player who 
is on the waitlist at the time of the withdrawal request.&nbsp;If the 
player’s spot is not filled, the TD has the choice to provide either a 
50% monetary&nbsp;refund of their entry fee or just the player’s pack 
the player would have received if they had attended (minus the cost of 
shipping). In the case of a player in a Pro division for an event 
without a Pro player pack worth at least 25% of the Entry Fee, the TD 
will provide the 50% monetary&nbsp;refund.</li>
<li>Players who officially request to withdraw from an event within 14 
days of the start of the event and prior to the event’s published 
closure of registration and waitlist replacements (within one week is 
recommended) will receive a 100% monetary&nbsp;refund minus up to a $10 
handling fee only if their spot in the tournament is filled by a player 
who is on the waitlist at the time of the withdrawal request. If the 
player’s spot is not filled, the TD has the choice to provide either a 
25%&nbsp;monetary&nbsp;refund or just the player’s pack they would have 
received if they had attended (minus the cost of shipping). In the case 
of a player in a Pro division for an event without a Pro player pack 
worth at least 25% of the Entry Fee, the TD will provide the 
25%&nbsp;monetary&nbsp;refund.</li>
<li>Players who request withdrawal within 48 hours of the start of play,
 or who request withdrawal after the published close of registration and
 the published end of waitlist replacements, are not entitled to a 
refund. If a TD fills a player’s spot with a player on the waitlist at 
the time of withdrawal after the published close of registration and the
 published end of waitlist replacements, but more than 48 hours prior to
 the start of play, that player must receive a 100% monetary refund of 
their entry fee.</li>
<li>Tournament Directors for Major, Elite Series, and A-Tier events may 
petition the PDGA Director of Event Support to change the timeline for 
items C, D, and E. If granted, the policy must be clearly published with
 all registration materials.</li>
<li>If a TD vacates an offered division due to a lack of registered players for the division (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/202">2.02.L</a>),
 any player for that division that does not wish to move to a different 
division that they are eligible for will be provided a full refund.</li>
<li>If a Tournament Director cancels an event, all currently registered 
or waitlisted players must receive a 100% monetary refund of their entry
 or waitlist fee. Only in the case of a disaster beyond the control of 
the TD that prevents the event from taking place by making the venue(s) 
unavailable, and only with prior approval from the PDGA Director of 
Event Support, may a TD provide players registered for Amateur divisions
 with a player pack and a partial monetary refund in the amount of the 
difference between the retail value of the player pack and the amount of
 the entry fee.</li>
<li>If a Tournament Director postpones an event, all players currently 
registered or waitlisted for the original date at the time of 
postponement must receive a 100% monetary refund of their entry or 
waitlist fee if they request it. Only in the case of a disaster beyond 
the control of the TD that prevents the event from taking place by 
making the venue(s) unavailable, and only with prior approval from the 
PDGA Director of Event Support, may a TD provide players registered for 
Amateur divisions with a player pack and a partial monetary refund in 
the amount of the difference between the retail value of the player pack
 and the amount of the entry fee. Once a new date is announced, all 
prior registrants who are still registered or waitlisted must be 
notified by email and given a reasonable opportunity to receive a 100% 
monetary refund of their entry or waitlist fee if they determine they 
are unable to attend the event on its new date.</li>
<li>It is highly recommended that high-capacity events do not include 
personalized items within their player packs due to the complexity that 
creates for withdrawals and refunds. Personalized items should only be 
offered as merchandise for purchase during registration for a separate 
non-refundable fee that is not part of the tournament entry fee.</li>
<li>For exceptions related to events outside the United States and Canada, please see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/603">6.03.C.1</a>.</li>

as a convenience to players.</li>
<li>Any player who does not check in by the time(s) specified by the

</li>
<li>The Tournament Director should notify players of check-in 
requirements on the registration page or via email no less than 48 hours
 prior to the earliest check-in time.</li>
<li>At A-Tier events using a staggered start with scheduled tee times, 
players must also check in with the starter no less than 5 minutes prior
 to their tee time each day and be present at the starting hole for the 5
 minutes preceding their tee time each day.&nbsp;Players who do not 
check in with the starter by this time or who are not present at the 
starting hole for the 5 minutes preceding their tee time receive two 
penalty throws added to their starting hole. This is recommended for 
staggered starts with scheduled tee times at all other Tiers.</li>
<li>If a player is later deemed to be absent for the first hole under <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/811">811.F.5</a>, Misplay, then the penalty in 1.04.C does not apply. The player only receives the penalty for being absent.</li>

<h3>Staggered start</h3>
<p>At a <dfn>staggered start</dfn>, also known as a <dfn>tee time start</dfn>, groups start one after another on a certain hole.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Groups shall start at the time announced by the Tournament Director and check in with the starter as required by 1.04.</li>
<li>Players may practice in any area designated by the Tournament 
Director until the starter indicates the two-minute signal for their 
group.</li>
<li>The course or courses are closed to practice while competitive 
rounds are in progress unless the Tournament Director specifies 
otherwise.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Flex start</h3>
<p>At a <dfn>flex start</dfn>, players may choose their own starting time, their own playing group, or both.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>This format is only available for one-day, one-round events sanctioned at C-Tier level and for Leagues.</li>
<li>The grouping and sectioning requirements of 1.06.A and C do not apply to flex starts.</li>
<li>The Tournament Director may adjust starting times and playing groups.</li>
<li>Flex starts are staggered starts in all other respects.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A throw by a player between the two-minute signal and the start of 
the round shall receive a warning if observed by two or more players or 
an official. Subsequent throws by the player during this period, if 
observed by two or more players or an official, shall result in one 
penalty throw added to the player’s score, regardless of the number of 
throws.</li>
<li>It is the sole responsibility of the player to know the course 
rules, be at their starting hole, and be ready to play in time for the 
start of their round.</li>
<li>Players who are absent for their starting hole or any subsequent hole have committed misplay (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/811">811.F.5 and 6, Misplay</a>).
 If a complete round is missed, or if a player does not finish a round, 
the player may, at the discretion of the Tournament Director, be 
disqualified.</li>
<li>Late-arriving players, for either Shotgun or Tee Time rounds, are 
responsible for checking with the TD, Tournament Central, or the Tee 
Time Starter to learn their correct starting group and are solely 
responsible for starting play with that playing group or the group 
created by the TD due to the player’s absence. Failure to do so is a 
misplay (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/811">811.F.10, Misplay</a>).</li>
<li>The Tournament Director must provide a scorecard to each player in 
the group. These scorecards may be digital or physical, so long as they 
meet the requirements in <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/808">808, Scoring</a>.See <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/603">6.03.D.1</a> for events outside the United States and Canada.</li>
<li>Paper scorecards must always be made available to each playing 
group, regardless of what the Tournament Director has declared to be the
 official method of scoring.</li>

<li>Professional and Amateur players should not be grouped together. Divisions should be grouped together as much as is practicable.</li>
<li>When there are more entrants than can play together in one round, 
the field of competitors may be split into pools. Players within a 
division must play the exact same layouts during competition.</li>
<li>All players within a division should be grouped for the first round via one of the following methods (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/105">1.05.B.3.b</a> and <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/603">6.03.E</a> for exceptions):<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>Random grouping; players within a division may be randomly grouped for the first round. All team events should use this option.</li>
<li>Player Rating grouping; players within a division may be grouped by 
player rating to set first round groups. Highest-rated player starting 
on the lowest number hole, the second-highest-rated player starting on 
the following hole, etc. This process would continue until all starting 
holes have been filled. For example, a division of 12 players across 3 
holes set by the ranking of their ratings would be:<br>
<ol type="a">
<li>Hole 1: Players 1, 4, 7, and 10</li>
<li>Hole 2: Players 2, 5, 8, and 11</li>
<li>Hole 3: Players 3, 6, 9, and 12</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In the case of a division that is large enough to be in multiple 
pools, the players must be split by rating (example: 72 highest ratings 
in Pool A and 72 lowest ratings in Pool B) and then randomized within 
each pool for the first round.</li>
<li>At PDGA Leagues, players may determine their own groups and, if the 
League uses staggered start times, their own start time (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/114">1.14.C.6</a>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For all subsequent rounds, players should be grouped by division as much as is practicable.</li>
<li>Within a division, players should be grouped by lowest score (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/109">1.09</a>
 for breaking ties). The group with the lowest scores starts on the 
lowest-numbered hole, and so on. If tee times are in use, the group with
 the lowest scores has the latest tee time.</li>
<li>For tiebreaking procedures for players with the same total score, see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/109">1.09</a>.</li>
<li>To promote fairness, groups shall not consist of fewer than three 
players, except under extenuating circumstances, as deemed necessary by 
the Tournament Director. In cases where fewer than three players are 
required to play together, a designated Tournament Official (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/112">1.12.A</a>) must accompany the group and may play as long as that does not interfere with the competing players.</li>
<li>Groups shall not be more than five players and should be limited to 
four players whenever possible. In teams play, groups may exceed five 
players due to team size or odd numbers of teams competing.</li>
<li>First round feature groups for media purposes are not allowed unless
 for video coverage and previously approved by each player within the 
group and by the PDGA Director of Event Support.</li>
<li>A ghost group is a designation for a secondary group of players that
 is assigned a starting hole already occupied by another group of 
players. Ghost groups are only to be used to resolve emergency 
situations, such as a hole being unexpectedly rendered unplayable by 
flooding, downed power line, or other circumstances outside the control 
of the Tournament Director.<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>A ghost group will always tee second on the hole as the 
lowered-numbered hole for both first-round groupings (see 1.06.B) and 
subsequent rounds (see 1.06.D).</li>
<li>Ghost groups should start on a shorter length hole after a 
longer/more difficult hole to minimize the impact on course-flow and 
speed of play.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>At staggered start events with scheduled tee times, Tournament 
Directors must post tee times on the PDGA event page for all players in a
 given division no later than 12 hours prior to the first tee time for 
that division or one hour after the conclusion of play of the previous 
round for that division, whichever is later.</li>

display storms and lightning strikes moving into the area) in order to 
suspend play before conditions become dangerous to the players, staff, 
and spectators. (see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pdga.com/pdga-documents/tournament-resources/pdga-mid-event-suspension-and-cancellation">PDGA Mid-Event Suspension &amp; Cancellation Policy</a>)</p>

<li>The field may be reduced (cut) for a semi-finals or finals at the 
discretion of the Tournament Director, provided that is announced prior 
to opening player registration for the event. The only exception may be

<li>Second, among players with identical round scores for the event, the

<li>
<h3>Playoffs:</h3>
<p>Except where noted below in 1.09.D, final ties for first place in any division must be broken by a <dfn>playoff</dfn>,
 either sudden-death or aggregate. If ties are being broken for the 
reduction of field size, they also must be broken by these procedures. 
Under no circumstances should any other method such as hot round, 
head-to-head scores, etc. be used to break a tie for first place. The 
Official Rules of Disc Golf and the Competition Manual apply during 
playoffs, but the throws do not accrue to the players' scores or break 
ties for any position other than first.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><dfn>Sudden-death</dfn> is a playoff format where the player or 
players with the lowest score on a hole move on to the next hole and all
 other players are eliminated. When only one player has the lowest score
 on a hole, that player has won the tiebreaker and sudden-death play is 
over.</li>
<li><dfn>Aggregate</dfn> is a playoff format where the competitors play a
 set of 6 or fewer holes that have been announced by the TD, where the 
lowest score on all holes wins the playoff. Players who are tied after 
an aggregate playoff proceed to sudden-death play on those same holes, 
unless a different set of holes has been announced by the TD.</li>
<li>Playoffs shall begin, wherever possible, on the same course and 
layout as the previous round on hole number one unless a different 
course, hole, or series of holes is designated by the Tournament 
Director prior to the start of the tournament.</li>
<li>Playoffs must use the same format as the previous round (e.g., medal
 play, match play, team play) unless another format is designated by the
 Tournament Director prior to the start of the tournament. In team play,
 each&nbsp;team is considered a player for the purposes of this section.
 Any playoff that uses team play to break ties for an event conducted 
wholly as singles play, or that uses singles play to break ties for an 
event conducted wholly as team play, must do so for a compelling 
competitive reason and must be approved prior to the start of the event 
by the Director of Event Support.</li>
<li>The specific order in which players tee off for the first hole of a 
playoff shall be determined by random draw (e.g., numbered playing 
cards, selecting tee positions from a hat, etc.).</li>
<li>In the case of a tied hole during sudden-death play, the teeing 
order for the next hole will rotate from the order used on the just 
completed hole, such that the player who teed first on the previous hole
 relative to the remaining players will now tee last, the player who 
teed second will now tee first, and so on.</li>
<li>During an aggregate playoff, the teeing order will instead rotate in the manner described by 802.02, Order of Play.</li>
<li>If the aggregate playoff ends with two or more players still tied, the teeing order will rotate:<br>
<ol type="a">
<li>in the manner described by 802.02 to set the teeing order for the first hole of sudden-death play; and</li>
<li>in the manner described by 1.09.B.6 for the remainder of sudden-death play.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Players may decline to participate in a playoff. Their ranking and 
cash or prizes will be determined as if they had declined to participate
 in a semi-final or final among the tied players (see 1.08.D).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>First place cash or prizes must be awarded to the division winner 
and listed in the event results. Cash or prizes may not be evenly split 
between any players tied for first place except as noted in 1.09.D.</li>
<li>Exceptions to the requirement for first place tiebreakers:<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>A tie for first place at a flex start event where a tied competitor has already left the event.</li>
<li>A tie for first place caused by the necessity of calling an event 
due to dangerous conditions where there is no time left on the regularly
 scheduled final day of competition to complete the event or break a tie
 for first place. Under no circumstances should players be expected, or 
asked, to return on a day following the last day of the regularly 
scheduled rounds to finish the event (see PDGA Mid-Event Suspension 
&amp; Cancellation Policy).</li>
<li>If a playoff cannot be held during the last day of regularly 
scheduled rounds for the competition, the tie for first place will stand
 with the players declared co-champions and the cash and prizes for the 
ranked places split between the players if two players are tied for 
first place, they split the first and second place cash or prizes).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Final ties for other ranks shall be officially recorded as ties. 
Prize money distribution to tied players (other than for first place) 
shall be determined by adding the total money allocated to the number of
 positions represented by the tied players and dividing that by the 
number of players tied. Trophy distribution for ties may be determined 
by a playoff or by any related disc golf skill event determined by the 
Tournament Director, but only for the purpose of awarding trophies; the 
players must remain officially recorded as tied in the results.</li>

<li>Any player accepting cash in a Professional division at a PDGA-sanctioned event (except Leagues, see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/114">1.14.C.2</a>)
 must have a PDGA number for tracking purposes prior to the start of the
 event (players receiving a PDGA number after event registration must 
alert the TD prior to the event). Non-PDGA-numbered players are only 
eligible for trophies, and any cash payouts at or below that place would
 move down one place causing an additional place to be paid.</li>
<li>An Amateur-class member playing in a Professional division (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/204">2.04.C</a>)
 may not accept merchandise in lieu of cash at events sanctioned at 
A-Tier and above; however, they may accept a trophy for their finishing 
place if available. &nbsp;All cash payouts at or below that place would 
move down one place causing an additional place to be paid. Amateurs 
playing in a Professional division may accept merchandise in lieu of 
cash at other Tier levels at the Tournament Director’s sole discretion. 
Otherwise, all cash payouts at or below that place would move down one 
place, causing an additional place to be paid. This does not apply to 
Leagues (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/114">1.14.C.3</a>).</li>
<li>The required Added Cash for a Tier level must be allocated across 
all Professional divisions based on the percentage of entry fees brought
 into the overall Professional portion of the event by each division. 
Added cash above the minimum may be allocated at the TD’s discretion.</li>
<li>Events with more than two rounds must post payout (including all added cash) prior to the start of the last round.</li>
<li>Any prizes (money or merchandise) declined by a player must pass 
down to the next finishing position(example: If a player placing third 
declines their prize, the player in fourth place will receive the 
third-place prize, the player in fifth will receive the fourth-place 
prize, etc.). Tournaments are allowed to retain prizes that have been 
declined by all players within a division only after the declined prizes
 have been passed through all finishing positions.</li>
<li>The usage of skins (and other similar formats) is permitted at PDGA 
events but those scores are not allowed to determine a player’s overall 
standing in the event and prizes are not credited towards a player’s 
winnings.</li>
<li>Any prizes that a player has earned will be distributed at the 
completion of the event once the results have been tabulated and 
verified.<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>Tournament Directors may award prizes earlier at their discretion.</li>
<li>Players who leave before the official distribution of prizes do not 
relinquish their winnings, but they are responsible for contacting the 
TD as soon as possible to arrange for claiming those winnings and are 
also responsible for any associated shipping costs.</li>
<li>If a TD uses electronic payments (such as PayPal) for Professional 
cash prizes, those prizes must be distributed within two business days 
of the completion of the event. TDs must provide cash or checks to those
 who do not have the ability to receive payment electronically.</li>
<li>If a TD uses merchandise vouchers for Amateur payout, they must be 
redeemable at the event or afterwards via online fulfillment. The TD 
must specify how payout will be handled in their pre-registration 
materials.</li>
<li>Any prizes (money, trophies, or merchandise) that remain unclaimed 
(through no fault of the TD) 30 days after the completion of the event 
are then relinquished by the player. TDs must make a reasonable effort 
to provide the payout to the player by contacting them, offering to 
ship, etc.&nbsp;A player has claimed a gift certificate, gift card, gift
 code, or similar prize upon receiving it, and this time limit does not 
apply to the redemption of such certificates, cards, codes, or similar

<li>Parents/guardians must be responsible for their children during 
PDGA-sanctioned events. Neither the PDGA staff nor the event staff are 
responsible for the children of tournament players, spectators, etc. 
during events. Parents/guardians may not leave unaccompanied children at
 or near the scoring area, clubhouse, or any other tournament venue. Any
 child younger than 13 years of age who is accompanying any player group
 must be supervised by an adult who is not part of that player group and
 not a caddie.</li>
<li>Players in the Junior ≤12, Junior ≤10, Junior ≤08, and Junior ≤06 
divisions must be accompanied by a parent or guardian during tournament 
rounds. Additionally, any player younger than 13 years of age must be 
accompanied by a parent or guardian regardless of the division they play
 in. A single parent or guardian may be responsible for multiple junior 
players in the same group if agreed upon by all of the parents/guardians
 prior to the start of the round. Players in the Junior ≤18 and Junior 
≤15 divisions may be accompanied by a parent or guardian during 
tournament rounds.</li>
<li>During PDGA-sanctioned tournament rounds, parents/guardians accompanying junior division players:<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>MAY assume the roles of a caddie; assist junior players with disc 
selection, throw selection, rule interpretations, or scorekeeping.</li>
<li>MAY NOT make or second rulings such as foot faults, courtesy violations, etc.</li>
<li>MUST encourage good sportsmanship by demonstrating positive support for all junior players in the group.</li>
<li>MUST place the emotional and physical well-being of all junior players in the group above the personal desire to win.</li>
<li>MUST refrain from the use of abusive or profane language.</li>
<li>MUST refrain from using drugs, alcohol, or tobacco.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Failure to adhere to the parent/guardian responsibilities outlined 
in section 1.13 shall result in the disqualification of the junior 
player or removal of the offending player, caddie, or guardian. Junior 
players under 13 years of age whose guardian has been removed may 
continue to play if a substitute guardian volunteers to take their place
 with the consent of the removed guardian.</li>
<li>The PDGA highly recommends that Tournament Directors create their 
tournament schedules to ensure that all players in the two youngest age 
groups, Junior ≤08 and Junior ≤06, be scheduled to play no more than 18 
holes in one day. Additionally, TDs should use their discretion to 
possibly limit the amount of daily play concerning the Junior ≤10 
divisions (age 10 and younger) depending on the length and strenuousness
 of their course.</li>

<li>PDGA Leagues are the lowest Tier of PDGA-sanctioned events. Rather 
than a single tournament, Leagues feature one round per week, on the 
same day of the week each week, for six to ten consecutive weeks (e.g., 
eight consecutive Mondays, or ten consecutive Fridays). Leagues may skip
 a week due to weather or other extenuating circumstances upon approval 
of PDGA staff.</li>
<li>A maximum of two layouts on the same course may be used in a given League round, but layouts and courses may vary week to week.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf">Official Rules of Disc Golf</a> and the Competition Manual apply to PDGA League play, with the following exceptions:<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>Non-current members and non-members do not pay a temporary membership fee to compete in Leagues (see 1.01.B.2).</li>
<li>Players may win cash prizes without having a PDGA member number (see 1.10.A).</li>
<li>Amateur players may accept cash prizes without affecting their Amateur status (see 2.02.G).</li>
<li>Where local law and event venue rules permit, players who are of 
legal age to do so may use or display alcohol between the two-minute 
signal and submitting their scorecard (see 3.03.B.5). However, players 
still may not drink to excess or be publicly intoxicated (see 3.03.B.6).</li>
<li>Children under 13 who are accompanying a group may be supervised by 
an adult in the playing group (see 1.13.A). Children under 13 
accompanying the playing group are subject to the provisions of 812, 
Courtesy, and 3.03, with any penalties incurred by that child applied to
 the supervising player.</li>
<li>The provisions of 1.06.A and B do not apply to Leagues.</li>
<li>Players may play in different divisions from week to week but may not play more than once in any given week of a League.</li>

<li><dfn>Open divisions</dfn> have no upper ratings boundary and no age requirements. They may have ratings floors at Major and Elite Series events (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/402">4.02</a>) or require that a member be Amateur-class or qualify under the Pros Playing Am rubric (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/205">2.05.A</a>). The open divisions are:<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mixed Pro Open (MPO)</li>
<li>Women's Pro Open (FPO)</li>
<li>Gold (RPA)</li>
<li>Mixed Amateur 1 (MA1)</li>
<li>Women's Amateur 1 (FA1)</li>

<li><dfn>Ratings-based divisions</dfn> have ratings caps that prevent higher-rated players from competing in those divisions. The ratings-based divisions are:<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>Blue (RAH)</li>
<li>Mixed Amateur 2 (MA2)</li>
<li>Women's Amateur 2 (FA2)</li>

 subject to the PDGA Policy on Eligibility for Gender-Based Divisions. 
Any division labeled "Women's" or "Girls" or whose division code has the
 prefix "FP," "FA," or "FJ" is a gender-based division.</li>
<li><dfn>Age-based divisions</dfn> are divisions where eligibility is 
based on the player's year of birth. For example, a player who turns 40 
in a given year is considered to be 40 for eligibility purposes for that
 whole year. Any division labeled "Masters" or "Juniors," or who code 
ends in a two-digit age such as "08" or "65," is an age-based division.</li>
<li><dfn>Collegiate divisions</dfn> are specialized Amateur-class divisions used exclusively at College Disc Golf events. The collegiate divisions are:<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mixed Collegiate Division 1 (MC1)</li>

  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><ol type="A">
<li>Players are not allowed to enter a division for which they are 
ineligible due to their membership status, player class, gender, age, or
 player rating. Please see the <a href="https://www.pdga.com/pdga-documents/tour-documents/divisions-ratings-and-points-factors">Divisions, Ratings, and Point Factors</a> table.</li>
<li>A player is solely responsible for knowing what division(s) they are
 eligible to compete in. Entry into an ineligible division may result in
 disqualification from the event and/or suspension from PDGA events (see
 <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/203">2.03</a> for exceptions).</li>
<li>After the close of registration, players may not request to change 
their division unless their division has three or fewer people. Players 
must request this prior to the start of competition. TDs may approve or 
deny this request in their sole discretion.</li>
<li>If, after the start of an event, a Tournament Director discovers 
that a player is in a division they are not eligible for, they may move 
that player to the correct division for subsequent rounds, but ONLY if 
both of the divisions played the exact same layout. If not, the player 
must be removed from the event.</li>
<li>Players may not compete more than once in a single event. Each entry
 on the PDGA calendar is considered a separate event. For Leagues, see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/114">1.14.C.7</a>.</li>
<li>A player must properly identify themselves by name and PDGA number 
when competing in a PDGA-sanctioned event. Players who wish to remain 
anonymous or who assume a false identity will be disqualified from the 
event and face potential suspension from the PDGA tour.</li>
<li>Professional players playing in a Professional division compete for 
money. Amateur players playing in a Professional division may only 
accept money by becoming a Professional, or they may decline money and 
accept only a trophy (if one is available) to retain their Amateur 
status (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/110">1.10.A and 1.10.B</a>). However, Amateurs who accept cash at PDGA Leagues do not become a Professional or lose their Amateur status by doing so (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/114">1.14.C.3</a>).</li>
<li>Players playing in an Amateur division compete for trophies and/or prizes.</li>
<li>Players who are eligible for gender-based divisions may compete in 
mixed divisions if they wish, but players who are only eligible for 
mixed divisions may not compete in gender-based divisions.</li>
<li>An Amateur player may compete in any Professional division for which they are eligible based on age, gender, and event format.</li>
<li>A PDGA Professional member may only compete in Amateur divisions in select cases (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/205">2.05</a>).</li>
<li>A Tournament Director may limit the divisions they wish to offer at 
their event by listing only the divisions they plan to offer on their 
registration form.<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>If a division is offered and at least four eligible players register for that division, that division must be held.</li>
<li>If a division is underserved as defined in <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/102">1.02.C.2.c</a>, the division must be held if at least one player registers for the division. This does not apply to Majors.</li>
<li>In all other cases, it is at the Tournament Director's discretion whether to hold the division or not (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/103">1.03.H</a> for refund policy in that case).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>PDGA members, whether current or not, shall be allowed to play in 
any offered division for which they are eligible. All local rules that 
force a player to move up divisions based on previous performance are 
invalid and are not applicable to PDGA members at PDGA-sanctioned 
events.</li>
<li>For players without a PDGA number, Tournament Directors may estimate
 their Player Rating based on direct knowledge of their demonstrated 
skill and ability.<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>If the player signs up for a ratings-based division (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/201">2.01.B</a>),
 the TD may use that estimated Player Rating to assign the player to a 
different ratings-based division or MA1 or FA1 as appropriate.</li>
<li>If the player registers for an open division (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/201">2.01.A</a>) or an age-based division (<a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/201">2.01.D</a>) for which they qualify, the player is treated the same as PDGA members (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/202">2.02.M</a>).</li>
<li>A player who is assigned a division by the TD under <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/202">2.02.N.1</a>
 and who then purchases a PDGA membership prior to the start of play may
 move to and compete in any ratings-based division for which they

true spirit of amateur athletics by presenting only trophies to the top 
finishers of the tournament rather than a payout in merchandise.</li>
<li>All players in the event receive equal value through player packs. A
 player pack may consist of commemorative items and/or tournament 
amenities.<br>

 is a type of warning whose effects persist through all rounds and 
sudden-death play. Otherwise, the Tournament Director will immediately 
disqualify the player. Actions that violate this standard include, but 
are not limited to:<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>Repeated and overt use of abusive or profane language, including any
 remarks or comments targeted at a player or group that are inconsistent
 with the PDGA's non-discrimination principles as outlined in <a href="https://www.pdga.com/documents/pdga-bylaws">Section II.D of the PDGA Bylaws.</a>.</li>
<li>Throwing items in anger (other than discs in play).</li>
<li>Overt rudeness or threatening behavior to anyone present.</li>
<li>Willful and overt destruction, abuse or vandalism of property, including animal and plant life (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/80303">803.03, Damaging the Course)</a>.</li>
<li>Excessive use of alcohol or public intoxication at the tournament site.</li>
<li>Overt failure or refusal to enforce the rules of disc golf during competition (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/80102">801.02.B, Enforcement</a>).</li>
<li>Obstruction of, or failure or refusal to cooperate with, any 
investigation by an official into the player’s conduct or the conduct of
 another player.</li>
<li>Deliberately seeking to manipulate one’s player rating through intentional misplay or withdrawal (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/811">811.E, Misplay</a>).</li>
<li>Activities not listed here or in 3.03.C which are in violation of 
federal, state or local laws or ordinances, park regulations or disc 
golf course rules.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li id="303C">The following actions also violate the above standard. 
Players who commit one or more of these violations will not receive a 
warning, and will be immediately disqualified by the Tournament 
Director:<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>Cheating: a willful attempt to circumvent the rules of play.</li>
<li>Physical attacks upon anyone present.</li>
<li>Public display or use of illegal or prohibited substances in 
violation of any applicable law (national/federal, state/provincial, 
local/city/county, et al) from the two-minute signal to the time the 
player's scorecard is submitted.</li>
<li>Public display or use of alcohol at PDGA events sanctioned at C-Tier or higher, or of cannabis (other than as permitted by the <a href="https://www.pdga.com/policies/cbd-product-use-policy">CBD Product Use Policy</a>)&nbsp;at
 PDGA events sanctioned at any Tier level, even where otherwise lawful 
or permitted, from the two-minute signal to the time the player's 
scorecard is submitted.&nbsp;This rule does not apply to Leagues, where,
 if local law and event venue rules permit it, players of legal age to 
do so may consume alcohol during the round (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/114">1.14.C.4</a>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Players are required to report any player misconduct to a Tournament
 Official when available or to the Tournament Director directly at the 
completion of the round.</li>
<li>Tournament Directors are required to report any disqualifications and player misconduct to the PDGA as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>Disqualified players shall forfeit any prize money or merchandise and shall not receive a refund of entry fees.</li>
<li>The public display or use of tobacco products by event staff, 
players, and by extension their caddies, is prohibited at all times at 
A-Tier events and at PDGA events of any Tier that solely offer Junior 
divisions. For policies at PDGA Major and Elite Series events, see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/404">4.04.A</a>.<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>This prohibition includes all smoking and chewing tobacco products, 
as well as electronic and vapor cigarettes, whether tobacco-based or 
not. This prohibition does not apply to smoking cessation products that 
do not produce vapor, such as nicotine gum, nicotine patches, or 
nicotine lozenges.</li>
<li>For players and their caddies, any violation of these prohibitions 
will be treated as a courtesy violation, and violators will be asked to 
put away the product until after the round has concluded. Subsequent 
violations are courtesy violations which receive penalty throws (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/812">812.C, Courtesy</a>). Repeated violations may result in disqualification (see 3.03.B).</li>
<li>At all non-junior events to which this policy applies, the 
Tournament Director may opt to provide designated smoking areas out of 
the public eye for players, caddies, and event staff to use during the 
round, and all rules concerning the pace of play still apply (see <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/302">3.02</a>).</li>
<li>At PDGA events of any Tier that solely offer Junior divisions, 
including the PDGA Junior World Championships, no designated smoking 
areas will be provided.</li>
<li>In cases where local laws and policies conflict with this policy, 
please contact the PDGA Director of Event Support for guidance.</li>

 PDGA recognizes that the strength of the organization and the 
sustainability of tournament disc golf are reliant on the partnership 
between the PDGA and the Tournament Director. In order to help the 
Tournament Director to better perform their job, the PDGA has endowed 
them with certain rights. The Tournament Director also has 
responsibilities to the PDGA and its players, including but not limited 
to the following:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>Any qualified, current PDGA member age 18 or over who 
is&nbsp;interested in running a PDGA-sanctioned event may be required to
 take and pass an online tournament procedures assessment test before 
being able to direct that event. That test will be based upon the <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf">Official Rules of Disc Golf</a> and the Competition Manual.&nbsp;PDGA members under the age of 18 may not be Tournament Directors.</li>
<li>Tournament Directors agree to follow PDGA sanctioning requirements for the event’s designated Tier level.</li>
<li>Tournament Directors may be required to sign a statement acknowledging that they have read the <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf">Official Rules of Disc Golf</a>
 and the Competition Manual, and agree to abide by and enforce their 
contents before being able to direct any PDGA-sanctioned event.</li>
<li>Tournament Directors must disclose the financial information for their tournaments as listed in the <a href="https://www.pdga.com/pdga-event-sanctioning-agreement">PDGA Sanctioning Agreement</a>&nbsp;or
 event agreement. However, beyond the PDGA-required disclosures, any 
additional release of tournament-related financial information is solely
 at the discretion of the Tournament Director.</li>
<li>Per <a href="https://www.pdga.com/documents/pdga-bylaws">Section II.D of the PDGA Bylaws</a>,&nbsp;Tournament
 Directors may not refuse service to anyone based on their race, age, 
religion, sexual orientation, color, national origin, disability, 
gender, gender identity, or ancestry</li>
<li>Tournament Directors must abide by <a href="https://www.pdga.com/documents/disciplinary-actions">active PDGA player disciplinary actions</a>.</li>
<li>Any issues that may arise during a tournament, whether or not 
covered in any existing PDGA document, including allegations of abuse of
 responsibilities by a Tournament Director, may be brought to the 
attention of the PDGA through the <a href="https://www.pdga.com/pdga-disciplinary-process">PDGA Disciplinary Process</a>.</li>
<li>Where an event does not meet the criteria or a Tournament Director does not meet the responsibilities set forth in the <a href="https://www.pdga.com/pdga-event-sanctioning-agreement">PDGA Sanctioning Agreement</a>, <a href="https://www.pdga.com/privacy">PDGA Privacy Policy</a>,
 and Competition Manual, the PDGA reserves the right to demote the event
 in the future, or to suspend the Tournament Director from running 
future events. See <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/competition-manual/603">6.03.I</a> for policies outside the United States and Canada.</li>
<li>Failure to properly report the results of an event or to meet the

division in which the player competes. Tournament Manager calculates 
this automatically.</li>
<li>Players who are not current PDGA members and who are competing on 
multiple days must pay the temporary membership fee for each day.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>To reclassify from Professional to Amateur, PDGA members must meet the following criteria:
<ol>
<li>The player has not accepted cash while competing in a Professional division within the past year.</li>
<li>The player has not previously been reclassified from Pro to Amateur within the past five years.</li>
<li>The player's rating is under the following thresholds based on their current PDGA age:<br>
<ol type="a">
<li><dfn>Players eligible only for mixed divisions</dfn><br>
<ol type="i">
<li>less than 970 for players under 40 years of age on their birthday in the current calendar year</li>
<li>less than 920 for players age 40-49 on their birthday in the current calendar year</li>
<li>less than 910 for players age 50-54 on their birthday in the current calendar year</li>
<li>less than 905 for players age 55-59 on their birthday in the current calendar year</li>
<li>less than 900 for players age 60-64 on their birthday in the current calendar year</li>
<li>less than 885 for players age 65-69 on their birthday in the current calendar year</li>
<li>less than 860 for players age 70-74 on their birthday in the current calendar year</li>
<li>less than 840 for players age 75 or older on their birthday in the current calendar year</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><dfn>Players eligible for both mixed and gender-based divisions</dfn><br>
<ol type="i">
<li>less than 875 for players under 40 years of age on their birthday in the current calendar year</li>
<li>less than 820 for players age 40-49 on their birthday in the current calendar year</li>

<li>less than 720 for players age 75 or older on their birthday in the current calendar year</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A player who meets requirements #1 and #2 above, but whose player 
rating does not meet requirement #3 above, may request a medical 
exemption reclassification, but only due to a permanent injury or 
condition that will prevent them from ever playing at their former 
level. For more information about medical reclassification, please 
contact the Event Support Team.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If mixed divisions are offered at an event, Tournament Directors 
must offer the corresponding women's division (e.g., if MA40 is offered,
 FA40 must also be offered). Split-day events count as a single event 
for the purposes of this provision. &nbsp;After one week of early 
registration as detailed in Competition Manual 1.02.C.2.c or one week of
 open registration, the TD may cease offering the division as long as 
Competition Manual 2.02.L permits it.</li>

<li>As measured from the morning of the first day of competition, 
courses are required to be set up and in their first-round tournament 
format for all official practice days:
<ol>
<li>Four (4) practice days prior to any World Championship.</li>
<li>Three (3) days prior to any other PDGA Major or Elite Series event.</li>
<li>One (1) day prior to an A-Tier. Where A-Tiers have temporary holes 
where targets are unavailable prior to the event, the teeing areas and 
target locations for those holes must be clearly marked on the official 
practice day.</li>
<li>No requirements for B-Tiers and below.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Tournament format means the course(s) must have:
<ol>
<li>All out-of-bounds (806.02), hazard areas (806.05), mandatories (804.01), and drop zones properly marked;</li>
<li>Event tee signs in place; and</li>
<li>All in-play branding assets in place.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>An official practice day is a day where the course(s) are set in the
 tournament format and available for practice for a minimum of six (6) 
daylight hours.</li>
<li>Players in the event must be informed of specific practice 
availability hours for all official practice days before the start of 
official practice days.</li>
<li>Where an event has required official practice days, no sanctioned 
events or other tournament-related events that prevent or impede these 
practice hours may take place on the course(s) during the day 
immediately prior to the beginning of competition.</li>
<li>Rule waivers. The following situations require a waiver from the 
Director of Event Support.&nbsp;Failure to obtain a waiver may result in
 the hole being thrown out when computing scores and/or ratings. See the
 Use of Non-Standard Rules at PDGA-Sanctioned Events document for more 
details.
<ol>
<li>Any non-standard rule;</li>
<li>A hole or course rules that limits the player’s normal OB options, such as an island green;</li>
<li>A mandatory where the drop zone is more than 10 meters away from the nearest point on the restricted plane.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>At PDGA-sanctioned events, bathrooms are required.
<ol>
<li>The event must have either a permanent bathroom or temporary bathroom on site at each venue that is:<br>
<ol type="a">
<li>accessible to all players;</li>
<li>stocked and serviced and in working order;</li>
<li>available no less than 60 minutes prior to the first tee time of the day; and</li>
<li>available for the duration of the event schedule and all event-related activities at the course(s) being played; and</li>
<li>a reasonable walking distance from the course(s) being played.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Tournament Directors who must rent facilities to comply with this 
are allowed to use the bathroom pass-through fee (see 5.04.A.3.d) to 
offset costs.</li>
<li>This provision does not apply to Leagues.</li>
<li>This provision does not apply to flex starts (see 1.05.B.3). The TD 
must notify players in pre-registration materials if no bathroom will be
 available at a flex start.</li>
<li>Please consult the PDGA Water and Bathroom Recommendations for best practices regarding bathrooms.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>It is the event’s responsibility to provide, at minimum, a specific 
course rules sheet to every player so they can play the course correctly
 and as intended.</li>
<li>Tournament Directors should be familiar with the Mid-Event 
Suspension and Cancellation Policy and create a plan for any foreseeable
 complications.</li>

<ol>
<li>PDGA-approved <strong>Championship</strong> targets of the same 
design and manufacturer are recommended for all events and are required 
for A-tier, Elite Series, and Major events.</li>
<li>PDGA-approved <strong>Standard</strong> targets may be used at B-tier, C-tier, and League events.</li>
<li>PDGA-approved <strong>Basic</strong> targets and non-approved basket targets may be used for C-tier and League events.</li>
<li>PDGA-approved <strong>Object</strong> targets are allowed under XB, XC, and League events, but this must be specified when submitting the PDGA Sanctioning Agreement.</li>
<li>Events that do not meet the target requirements due to emergency, 
such as a basket destroyed by a falling tree with no suitable 
replacement available, may request a waiver by contacting the PDGA 
Director of Event Support at <a href="mailto:eventsupport@pdga.com">eventsupport@pdga.com</a>.</li>
<li>Please see the <a href="https://www.pdga.com/technical-standards">PDGA Technical Standards</a> for target classifications and further information.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Required Minimum Distances Between PDGA Events. See 6.03.K.2 for events outside the United States and Canada.
<ol>
<li>Minimum distances are required between sanctioned tour events in order to avoid a scheduling conflict.</li>
<li>The PDGA gives priority of dates to Majors, Elite Series, and A-Tiers, and handles the scheduling of these events directly.</li>
<li>State Coordinators are responsible for the scheduling of B and C 
Tier events and should give preference to reliable events with a 
successful history, and then to smaller or new events where there is no 
scheduling conflict.</li>

rated if at all possible. See the <a href="https://www.pdga.com/rules/non-standard-rules">Use of Non-Standard Rules at PDGA-Sanctioned Events</a> document for more details.</li>
<li><dfn>Restricted Eligibility Requirements (ratable)</dfn>. These are 
events where eligibility is limited based on citizenship and/or 
residence (example: a state decides to have their State Championships 
open to only players from that state) or PDGA Club member status. These 
events are ratable so as long as they do not use alternative competitive
 formats and do not have non-ratable non-standard rules.</li>
<li><dfn>Modified Payout Requirements (ratable)</dfn>. These are events run under the <a href="https://www.pdga.com/td/pdga-competition-endowment-program">Competition Endowment Program</a>
 to raise funds for a designated 501(c)(3) charity or school-affiliated 
disc golf program or team. All CEP events must be approved by the PDGA 
Event Support Team. Net entry fees are reduced by the amount donated 
per-player to the charity when calculating payout. These events are 
ratable so as long as they do not use alternative competitive formats 
and do not have non-ratable non-standard rules.</li>
<li><dfn>Simplified Rules of Disc Golf</dfn>. These are events run under
 the SRDG. All events using the SRDG must be approved by PDGA Event 
Support. These events are ratable so long as they do not use alternative
 competitive formats or non-standard rules.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>X-designated events are sanctioned as XM, XA, XB, and XC in 
accordance with tier guidelines and player points are awarded 
accordingly.</li>
<li>All X-designated event formats must be pre-approved by the PDGA Event Support Team.</li>
<li>Formats at B-tier and above are limited to Singles, Doubles, Team, 
and Match Play. Other event formats will be considered by the PDGA Event
 Support Team upon request.</li>
<li>Regardless of the format used, results must be easily convertible to
 PDGA divisions for player point calculation and data entry. For this 
reason, divisional doubles (pro, advanced, etc.) and mixed doubles 
(male/female) cannot be combined within the same event and will require 
separate TD Reports.</li>
